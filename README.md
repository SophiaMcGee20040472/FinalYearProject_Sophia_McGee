# Retro Revival: My Final Year Project 
##  Student Name: Sophia McGee
##  Student No. 20040472

Retro Revival is a music app that uses React and Redux, along with Tailwind CSS and the Shazam API, to offer a seamless experience for exploring and discovering new music. With Redux, it provides state management for smooth interactions. The retro aesthetic, with a purple, orange, and black color scheme, adds to the vintage feel, while intuitive UX design enables easy navigation between genres and chart-toppers. Combining local streaming and API integration, Retro Revival delivers a secure and reliable platform for all music enthusiasts. Relive the past and discover new favorites with Retro Revival!

I have create three branches called main Phase1 and Phase2 where I have added different features gradually and finally merged them back together to prepare for deployment. To run this application you will need an npm install and the command to run it is npm run dev and with storybook it is npm run storybook. There may be other installations needed to get started but I can't remember.

I have build a music app using JavaScript, React 18, Tailwind CSS, Storybook, Vite, Redux, MongoDB, Hapi, Node.js, and the Shazam Core API, I'm proud to say that I'm making great progress towards creating an app that is both powerful and user-friendly.

Node.js has been an excellent addition to my app, providing a reliable and efficient platform for building server-side applications. I'm was excited to integrate it with React to create a seamless and responsive user experience.

In addition, the incorporation of the Shazam API is a significant milestone in my music app project. This feature will allow users to identify and discover music tracks easily, enhancing the overall music discovery experience.

By leveraging these technologies, I'm confident that my app will provide users with an unparalleled music discovery experience. My focus on creating a user-friendly interface, coupled with the latest technologies, will ensure that my app is both functional and visually appealing.

Overall, I'm proud of the progress I've made. With the right implementation of these technologies, I'm confident that I'll be able to provide users with a powerful and engaging music app. Although I have not gotten full functionality with the music I believe I have achieved what I could in the time frame I had and have successful achieved proof of concept.
